Hotkey Activation for Nerd Dictation
====================================

This document describes the hotkey functionality for nerd-dictation, which provides
instant voice-to-text activation using a double-tap hotkey.

Features
--------

- **Double-tap activation**: Quick double-tap to toggle dictation on/off
- **Configurable hotkeys**: Choose from Caps Lock (default), Right Alt, AltGr, or Menu key
- **Audio feedback**: Plays sounds when starting/stopping dictation
- **Model ready detection**: Prevents activation attempts before model loads (with error sound)
- **Fast response**: Keeps model loaded in memory using suspend/resume
- **Auto-recovery**: Automatically restarts if nerd-dictation crashes
- **Device selection**: Support for specific audio input devices
- **Instance management**: Prevents duplicate processes and cleans up orphaned instances

Installation
------------

1. Install the required Python module:

   .. code-block:: bash

      uv pip install pynput

2. Ensure you have audio playback support (PipeWire or PulseAudio)

3. Place the ``hotkey.py`` script in your nerd-dictation directory

Usage
-----

Basic usage with default settings (double-tap Caps Lock):

.. code-block:: bash

   python hotkey.py

Use a different activation key:

.. code-block:: bash

   # Right Alt key
   python hotkey.py --key alt_r

   # AltGr key (international keyboards)
   python hotkey.py --key alt_gr

   # Menu/Compose key
   python hotkey.py --key menu

Specify an audio device:

.. code-block:: bash

   python hotkey.py --device "alsa_input.usb-webcam.analog-stereo"

Configuration
-------------

The script uses the following settings:

- **Double-tap timeout**: 300ms between taps
- **Audio format**: 16kHz sample rate (optimal for speech recognition)
- **Input method**: PW-CAT (PipeWire) or SOX
- **Output method**: SIMULATE_INPUT with xdotool

Sound Files
-----------

The script uses audio feedback to indicate different states:

- ``sounds/ready.wav``: Played once when the model finishes loading (startup complete)
- ``sounds/start.wav``: Played when dictation is activated (microphone on)
- ``sounds/stop.wav``: Played when dictation is suspended (microphone off)
- ``sounds/error.wav``: Played when errors occur:
  
  - Model not ready yet (double-tap before startup completes)
  - Process crashes or fails to start
  - Out of memory errors

If these files don't exist, the script will run silently.

**Startup sequence**: When you first run the script, you'll see "Waiting for model to load..." 
and after a few seconds (depending on model size), you'll hear the ready sound indicating 
the system is ready for dictation.

Troubleshooting
---------------

**No text appears when speaking:**

- Check that your microphone is working and not muted
- Verify the VOSK model is properly installed in ``~/.config/nerd-dictation/model``
- Try running ``nerd-dictation begin --verbose 2`` directly to debug

**Double-tap not detected:**

- Ensure you're tapping quickly enough (within 300ms)
- Some keyboards may have limitations with certain keys
- Try using a different activation key

**"xdotool not found" error:**

- Install xdotool: ``sudo apt install xdotool`` (Debian/Ubuntu)
- For Wayland, you may need to configure ``--simulate-input-tool`` differently

Technical Details
-----------------

The hotkey script:

1. **Startup safety**: Checks for and cleans up any existing nerd-dictation processes
2. **Process management**: Prevents multiple instances of hotkey.py from running
3. **Model loading**: Starts nerd-dictation in suspended state and monitors output
4. **Ready detection**: Plays a sound when model is loaded and ready for use
5. **Keyboard monitoring**: Uses double-tap detection to avoid accidental activation
6. **Fast toggling**: Sends resume/suspend commands for instant response
7. **Error handling**: Plays error sounds and provides clear messages on failures
8. **Memory protection**: Monitors for out-of-memory conditions
9. **Clean shutdown**: Properly stops processes and removes PID files on exit

This approach provides near-instant activation compared to loading the model
each time dictation starts, while preventing system resource issues.

Desktop Autostart
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Create ``~/.config/autostart/nerd-dictation-hotkey.desktop``:

.. code-block:: ini

   [Desktop Entry]
   Type=Application
   Name=Nerd Dictation Hotkey
   Comment=Double-tap Caps Lock for voice dictation
   Exec=/path/to/nerd-dictation/hotkey.py
   Icon=audio-input-microphone
   Hidden=false
   NoDisplay=false
   X-GNOME-Autostart-enabled=true
   StartupNotify=false
   Terminal=false

Or use your desktop environment's GUI:

- **GNOME**: Settings → Startup Applications
- **KDE**: System Settings → Startup and Shutdown → Autostart
- **XFCE**: Settings Manager → Session and Startup → Application Autostart
